    Create a CF-style time dimension.

    The Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions define standardized conventions for how to represent geophysical

    standard representation is to give time in units of seconds/minutes/hours/days since a base time in a particular
    calendar. This function handles creating the a time dimension and associated variable from any array-like object of
    datetime-like object.
